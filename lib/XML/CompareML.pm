=head1 NAME

XML::CompareML - A processor for the CompareML markup language

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.2.5

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use XML::CompareML::HTML;

    my $converter =
        XML::CompareML::HTML->new(
            'input_filename' => "my-comparison.xml",
            'output_handle' => \*STDOUT,
        );

    $converter->process();

Or alternatively:

    use XML::CompareML::DocBook;

    my $converter =
        XML::CompareML::DocBook->new(
            'input_filename' => "my-comparison.xml",
            'output_handle' => \*STDOUT,
        );

    $converter->process();

=head1 USAGE

The CompareML language is currently undocumented, but one can see
an example for a document written it in the
C<t/files/scm-comparison.xml> example in the distribution.

To convert a CompareML document to HTML instantiate an XML::CompareML::HTML
object, and pass it the filename as the C<input_filename> named parameter,
and a reference to the IO handle to output the result as the C<output_handle>
named parameter.

To convert a CompareML document to DocBook do the same procedure only using
an XML:CompareML::DocBook object.
